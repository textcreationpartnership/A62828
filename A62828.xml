            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Was not ſurpriz'd my ſelf at the ſucceſs of this Paſtoral; I confeſs my Friends thought the Town would have been kinder to it, and I was once almoſt tempted to be of their opinion; but the knowledge I have had of the diſpoſition of an Audience towards ſuch things, kept me from expecting any very good uſage from 'em. 'Twas indeed unreaſonable for me to hope they would be pleas'd with a perſon who had conſulted their pleaſure no more than I did.</p>
            <p>If the Paſtoral had been entirely my own, they would, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, have ſhewn their reſentments ſome other way, and not have been contented with neglecting it. They avoided it becauſe they were afraid to condemn it boldly, leſt they ſhould make themſelves ridiculous. For ſome, who never read any of <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s writings, have heard ſo much of their excellence, that they durſt not appear openly againſt it; and it muſt he very uneaſie for them to ſee a Play, which they are engag'd not to commend, and yet can't take the liberty to condemn, without expoſing their own judgments. However, there were others who could not be reſtrain'd, and 'twas in vain to tell 'em they ſhould he cautious in their cenſures of a Poem, which has been admir'd ſo many ages. A Poem, which the Great <hi>Taſſo</hi> preferr'd to his <hi>Gieruſallemme.</hi> In which the moſt beautiful thoughts of the Ancients (in this kind) are to be found, and which all that know any thing of the Author, or his Writings, think the beſt he ever writ: A Poem, which the Learned Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Menage</hi> thought worth his remarks; of which <hi>Paſtor Fido</hi> is but an Imperfect Copy; Tho for that very reaſon it met with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb facs="tcp:106312:3"/>treatment en our Theatre; for the Characters there, which never fail'd pleaſing an Audience, are unnatural and monſtrous. But there looks ſomething in <hi>Paſtor Fido</hi> like Intrigue, which will always have a good effect, where people are ſo fond of Gallantry, that they will not ſuffer ſo much as a Shepherd to appear without it.</p>
            <p>I can't imagine what was ſaid lately, with too much ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Shepherds Calendar excels the <hi>Aminta,</hi> prejudic'd the world againſt it; or that any body who have read it, will think <hi>Spencer</hi>'s Paſtoral equal to <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s. Is there any thing in <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>'s comparable to the ſtory of the Bee in the firſt Act, or the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which <hi>Daphne</hi> gives of <hi>Sylvia</hi>'s admiring herſelf in the Fountain, in the ſecond Act of the <hi>Aminta.</hi> Some perſons (and among the reſt Father <hi>Bouhours</hi>) have accus'd this laſt thought of too much affectation, and fancy 'tis not natural enough for a Shepherdeſs; but as Monſieur <hi>Fontenelle</hi> obſerves, if this is a fault, we may ſpare our ſelves the trouble of reading <hi>Guarini, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narelli,</hi> and <hi>Marino.</hi> For this very thought of <hi>Sylvia's</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the beſt of theirs, is the moſt ſimple thing in the world; and he adds in the next ſentence, that the <hi>Aminta</hi> is indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably the beſt Paſtoral which <hi>Italy</hi> has produc'd, and every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad is of his opinion.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible many of the original Graces muſt be loſt, our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage wants too much of the ſoftneſs of the <hi>Italian,</hi> to render it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually beautiful in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> But I hope few of his thoughts have eſcapt me; and Monſieur St. <hi>Evermont,</hi> who confeſſes he is not a perfect Maſter of the Tongue, ſays the delicacy of thought in the <hi>Aminta</hi> has touch'd him ſo much, that he believes there never was an <hi>Italian</hi> more pleas'd with it. My Judges, who perhaps are not all as good Criticks as he is, not expecting any thing like this in the Paſtoral, were very far from his ſentiments, and did not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt that there could be a thought in it too delicate for them. 'Twould be an affront to their taſte to think it was not nice enough to perceive the Beauties, which almoſt every page of <hi>Taſſo</hi> is full of; and I know they will not believe all that this Gentleman has ſaid ſome where elſe, that there is no Country in <hi>Europe</hi> where the Men have more Courage, the Women more Beauty, and both more Wit than in <hi>England;</hi> but then there is no place where a good taſte is ſo rarely to be met with. If they could have agreed to this, they
<pb facs="tcp:106312:3"/>had not been ſo forward in cenſuring <hi>Amintas,</hi> leſt they might by chance make a wrong judgment, which very often falls out. They were not now long conſulting what to do with it, but whether they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it or not, they were poſitive there was nothing in it, and moſt judiciouſly condemn'd what happens to be in the Original, the beſt thing of the kind that ever was or I believe ever will be written. There was no need of ſaying ſo much to vindicate <hi>Taſſo,</hi> his reputation is fix'd, and 'tis not in the power of Malice or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to injure it. As for the Tranſlation, if there are any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in it to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Authors prejudice. I deſerve to be blam'd, but tho I have heard the Conduct of the Play, the meaſure of the Verſe, and the management of the Repreſentation accus'd, yet none, as I know of, have laid any thing to my charge on that account. If they had, I ſhould have taken this opportunity to confeſs my errors or anſwer their objections. The Conduct of this Pastoral is the ſame as I found it, (except in the laſt Act, which I was oblig'd to alter) and I may therfore affirm the moſt correct that ever was ſeen on an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Theatre. If there had been iatrigue, a great deal of ſtir, and ſomething elſe in it, it had been more acceptable perhaps to thoſe whoſe protection I deſir'd, and whoſe pleaſure I chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd: but I was miſtaken, and ſince I endeavour to pleaſe them in every thing I write, I ſhall next time avoid that unpardonable Crime, which ruin'd <hi>Amintas</hi> on the Stage, and not venture ſo much on their complaiſance for the future.</p>
            <p>There are few who conſider the nature of Paſtaral, that the Action ought to be ſimple, the Paſſions tender, and the Sentiments ſuch, as are ſuitable to people bred up in eaſe and innocence. The nearer a man comes to this rule, the more perfect will his writings of this kind be: but the age is not yet prepar'd to be diverted with any thing ſimple, eaſie and innocent; and it may 'thad been prudence in me to have waited till ſome perſon ſhould have attempted to pleaſe it this way, whoſe name might have given an authority to ſuch an Innovation. Tho 'tis to be fear'd, thoſe who have rais'd their Characters by Licentiouſneſs and Irregularity, will not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard loſing 'em by writing correctly and decently; and yet many of 'em are ſo well ſettled in the good opinion of the publick, that whatever the ſhould promote would infallibly ſucceed. And it may not be improper to obſerve here, what an influence Fame has
<pb facs="tcp:106312:4"/>on Certian Authors, who, having grown popular with their Fuſtian and Nonſence, have in time deſerv'd by writing well, the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their ill Verſes acquird 'em; ill uſage has frequently the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, and ſuch as have done well, when they have not met with the applauſe they deſerv'd, by endeavouring after to do better; have made the firſt judgments that, were made of 'em juſt.</p>
            <p>Some think the meaſure of the Verſe too ſhort, but <hi>Taſſo</hi> drew me in to this Error, if 'tis one, for ſince he thought the <hi>Italian,</hi> which is the ſweeteſt Language in the World, wanted to be made yet more ſoft by the ſhortneſs of the meaſure; I believ'd the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Heroick would be too Majeſtick, and not ſo agreeable to the great ſimplicity which ſhould every where appear in a Paſtoral, as Verſe of ſeven or eight Syllables.</p>
            <p>The management of the repreſentation, particularly that part on't which I undertook, was very ill contriv'd. The ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance I have had with ſuch things did not qualify me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take what I did, and the ſucceſs was anſwerable to the contrivance. I ſuppoſe every part of the Repreſentation might have been orderd to more advantage, tho the Actors performd theirs as well as could be expected, and I queſtion if any other Company would have done it better. But be the Management or the Action what it will, I am ſatisfy'd nothing could have drawn an audience to it, when once they had heard what they were to be entertaind with, and that their attention was required for three hours without one jeſt to divert 'em. I ſaw this the firſt night, and ſhould have been much more diſcourag'd if ſome men of ſenſe, whoſe judgments I can ſafely depend on, had not aſſur'd me that there was no reaſon for't, and that the could not without reſentment, ſee the partiality of ſeveral perſons, which might have been employ'd to more purpoſe againſt other, who Court their applauſe, and value their opinion more than I can.</p>

                  <l>Round ſome dead Animal they ſtood,</l>
